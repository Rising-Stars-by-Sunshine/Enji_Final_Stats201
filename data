## Description
This dataset compiles Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) indicators reported by the World Bank, harmonized for global comparability. Indicators cover domains such as energy access, emissions, literacy, sanitation, and governance scores. For this project, we curate a **subset of 11 indicators** across the three ESG pillars, spanning 1990–2023. This tidy panel structure supports reproducible machine-learning analysis, including clustering and forecasting.
